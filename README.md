# SWCLM
This study proposes a data-driven, Stage-Weighted Covering Location Model (SWCLM) for waste-bin management in scenic areas. By explicitly incorporating the characteristics of waste-bin siting problems, the proposed framework integrates demand weighting and staged decision-making to support efficient and adaptive bin location planning.
